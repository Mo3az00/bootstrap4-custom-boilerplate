# Custom Bootstrap 4 Boilerplate

This boilerplate was created to quickly start any new project using version 4 of the famous [Bootstrap Framework](http://getbootstrap.com/), the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icons and the [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) build tool.

## Requirements

* NodeJS 8+
* npm package manager  

## Installation

Download the files, extract them to your project root directory and run the following command on your terminal:

```npm run setup```

That's it!

## Editing SCSS and JS

As [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is already loaded and a generic ___Gulpfile___ is in the root project directory, you can use the built-in watcher to compile everything for you, while you edit.

The only thing you need to do is to run the following command in your terminal:

```gulp watch```
